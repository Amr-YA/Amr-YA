###  Hey ðŸ˜„

#### Iâ€™m Amr Yasser <a href=https://github.com/Odd-Baron/Odd-Baron>@Odd-Baron</a>, I'm from Egypt.

I've always been interested in programming and C.S and wanted to learn it.

Starting 2020, I've decided to follow that passion and learn data analysis and machine learning using python.

Previously I worked as a planning engineer, I was responsible for creating reports to forecast and analyse projects, to ease the decision making process.
Working as a planning engineer is actually what made me interested in data analysis, 
because it's the same process but with advanced and more systematic tools and tecnhiques.

I'm always interested in challenging projects and new ideas. Currently I'm working on creating a chat bot that can help real estate agents manage clients more effortlessly.
