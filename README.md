###  Hey ðŸ˜„

#### Iâ€™m Amr Yasser <a href=https://github.com/Amr-YA/>@Amr-YA</a>.

I've always been interested in programming and C.S and wanted to learn it.
Starting 2020, I've decided to follow that passion and learn data analysis and machine learning using python.

Previously I worked as a planning engineer, I was responsible for creating reports to forecast and analyse projects, to ease the decision making process.
Working as a planning engineer is actually what made me interested in data analysis, because it's the same process but with advanced and more systematic tools and tecnhiques.

I'm always seeking challenging projects and new ideas.
