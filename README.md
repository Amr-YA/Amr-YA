###  Hey ðŸ˜„

#### Iâ€™m Amr Yasser <a href=https://github.com/Amr-YA/>@Amr-YA</a>.

Starting 2020, I've decided to follow my passion and learn data analysis and machine learning. Previously I worked as a planning engineer, I was responsible for creating reports to forecast and analyse projects, to ease the decision making process. Which actually what made me interested in data analysis, because it's the same process but with advanced and more systematic tools and tecnhiques.

I'm always seeking challenging projects and new ideas.
